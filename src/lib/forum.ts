    fullContent: `
A 19-year-old male presented to my clinic with a chief complaint of progressively blurry vision and shadowing in his left eye over the past 6 months. His right eye is asymptomatic.

**History:**
- No significant past ocular history.
- No history of eye rubbing.
- Family history is negative for keratoconus or other corneal ectasias.
- Systemic history is unremarkable.

**Examination (Left Eye):**
- **UCVA:** 20/80
- **BSCVA:** 20/40 with -1.50 / -4.50 x 075
- **Slit Lamp:** Clear cornea, no visible Vogt's striae or Fleischer ring. Deep and quiet anterior chamber.
- **Topography:** Shows inferior steepening, but the axis is atypical and the classic "kissing doves" pattern is not present. Pachymetry shows thinning inferiorly, but not as dramatic as expected for classic KC.

I've attached the corneal topography maps for review. I'm considering early keratoconus, but the presentation is atypical. I'm also thinking about Pellucid Marginal Degeneration, though the thinning is not strictly peripheral.

What are your thoughts on the differential diagnosis? What would be your next steps in management? Would you consider corneal cross-linking at this stage given the documented progression of astigmatism?

Any insights would be greatly appreciated.
