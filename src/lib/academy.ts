    description: "As our **inaugural event** on the Focus Links platform, this session on Contact Lens Induced Keratitis (CLIK) was a memorable success. Despite some initial technical lag, our esteemed speaker, **Abhishek Kumar Banaita**, delivered an insightful presentation on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of CLIK. The session truly came alive during the Q&A portion, where the engagement from our participants was phenomenal. We extend our heartfelt thanks to our organizer, **Mohd Asad**, for making this milestone event possible.",
