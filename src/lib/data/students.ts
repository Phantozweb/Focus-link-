    bio: `I’m Janarthan Veeramani, a third-year B.Sc. Optometry student, on a mission to make eye care smarter, more accessible, and deeply human-centered.

My journey began at LIHSM, Coimbatore, where I discovered that my true strength lies in creative thinking, not just academics. That mindset inspired me to build the tools I once wished I had as a student—tools that support smarter learning, clinical reasoning, and collaboration.

I’m the founder of Focus-IN, a growing ecosystem of AI-powered tools designed to empower optometry students and practitioners across India. As the Head of Administration at OptoBharat, I focus on connecting fellow students, fostering collaboration, and creating opportunities for shared learning and professional growth.

I also authored the research paper “Visual Telepathy: How Bionic Eyes Could Transform Communication,” published in IJFMR, exploring how bionic vision may revolutionize the way we connect.

**"Balancing academics, clinical exposure, and development work is not easy but it's my way of transforming ideas into impact."**

A special thanks to **Mrs. Vijayalakshmi Nivethitha Krishnan (Viji Mam)**, whose mentorship helped transform me from a simple, curious student into someone who thinks with clarity, confidence, and purpose. Her influence continues to shape the vision behind everything I build.

Let’s connect and co-create the future of optometry through bold ideas, smart tools, and a vision that empowers everyone.`,
